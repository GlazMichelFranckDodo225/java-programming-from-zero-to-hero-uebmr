Variables
Introduction
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Declaring (Creating) Variables
To create a variable, you must :
    -	specify :
        o	the type,
        o	the name of the variable,
    -	assign a value (“equal sign” is used to assign values to the variable).
type variableName = value;

Variable Naming Rules

Introduction
    -	ALL JAVA VARIABLES MUST BE IDENTIFIED WITH UNIQUE NAMES CALLED IDENTIFIERS :
        o	Identifiers can be :
            	short names (like x and y),
            	more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
Note : It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code :
// Good
int minutesPerHour = 60;

// OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
int m = 60;

General rules
Names or Identifiers :
    -	can contain :
        o	Letters and digits (alphanumeric characters),
        o	underscores,
        o	and $ (dollar sign).
    -	must begin with :
        o	a letter,
        o	$ (dollar sign),
        o	or  _ (underscore).
    -	cannot contain whitespace.
    -	are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables).
    -	Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be
    used as names.
    -	Convention : Names or Identifiers should start with a lowercase letter
    except Constant Variables.
